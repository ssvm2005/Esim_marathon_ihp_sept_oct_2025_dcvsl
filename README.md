1-Bit Full Adder Implementation Using DCVSL (Differential Cascode Voltage Switch Logic) High-speed, low-power full adder circuit designed using Differential Cascode Voltage Switch Logic (DCVSL). The project demonstrates efficient logic design for arithmetic circuits in VLSI with reduced transistor count and minimal static power dissipation.
