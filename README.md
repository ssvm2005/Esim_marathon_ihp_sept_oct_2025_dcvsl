1-Bit Full Adder Implementation Using DCVSL (Differential Cascode Voltage Switch Logic) High-speed, low-power full adder circuit designed using Differential Cascode Voltage Switch Logic (DCVSL). The project demonstrates efficient logic design for arithmetic circuits in VLSI with reduced transistor count and minimal static power dissipation.

This project presents the design and analysis of a 1-bit Full Adder using Differential Cascode Voltage Switch Logic (DCVSL).
The design focuses on achieving:
  -> High-speed operation
  -> Low power consumption
  -> Area efficiency
DCVSL provides both true and complementary outputs with minimal static power dissipation, making it an ideal choice for arithmetic building blocks in VLSI systems.
The project is build using Open Source Tools like eSim and Ngspice. The objective of the marathon was to implement circuits using IHP-SG13G2. The attached output waveforms include the default esim nmos,pmos 180nm mosfets. The .cir.out file used for IHP-SG13G2 is also attached.
